## TODOs

#### intro

* [ ] what is a consensus algoritm role, what is it used for. Recall the importance of Bitcoin Proof-of-work, the need for "better" versions, the trade-offs that usualy need to be made...
* [ ] Recall the different types of blockchain, the usual chain and the other forms it can have.
* [ ] Shows the impact the type of blockchain and the problem it rises on consensus.
