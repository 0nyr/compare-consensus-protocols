Read the Wikipedia [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) article to get me started with the basics.

### Mon 7 March 2022

Started to code a blockchain node from scratch. I'm still having many questions on what features I should have and what to keep minimal. My goal is to have nodes capable of connecting to one another, and mining blocks.

* [ ] Finish implementing Blockchain
* [ ] Making a CLI to start the node on a specified port
* [ ] scanning ports
* [ ] establishing inter-node connection.
* [ ] Trying the node alone first.
